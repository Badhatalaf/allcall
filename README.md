# Welcome to the source code of AllCall
Well, AllCall is a open source platform where anyone can video chat with other people.
## What's special about it
In other video chat apps, one need to make their own id and password then download the app setup the app blablabla. But in AllCall, just enter the url and join the room without going through the whole process.

And sorry about the frontend, it may be a bit messy but works fine.
